# Machine_Learning_2017
Homework repo for Machine Learning

### Description: 
This class covers a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning methods, such as support vector machines, clustering algorithms, ensemble learning, Bayesian networks, Gaussian processes, and anomaly detection. I learned machine learning strategies, such as how to select and combine models to make real world predictions with different data set. 

### Key Words:
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Naive Bayes Classifiers
* Beyesian Network
* Gaussian Process (GP) 
* Anomaly Detection

1. Building a __decision tree__ classifier, using decision tree to predict burden of disease with __hyperperameter tuning__ [link](https://github.com/SPTKL/Machine_Learning_2017/blob/master/HW1/HW1-Decision%2BTrees%2Band%2BRandom%2BForests_bc1561.ipynb)

2. Visualizing and training __SVM__ models, training a __Naive Beyes classifier__. [link](https://github.com/SPTKL/Machine_Learning_2017/blob/master/HW2/Homework%202.ipynb)

3. __Bayesian Network Learning__; Studying Spatial and Temporal Distributions of Chicago Crimes using clustering [link](https://github.com/SPTKL/Machine_Learning_2017/blob/master/HW3/MLC_HW3_bc1561.ipynb)

4. Using __Gaussian Process__ to model traffic count as a function of spatial location. Cluster-based __anomaly detection__ using __Kmeans, Gaussian mixture, and Isolation Forest__ [link](https://github.com/SPTKL/Machine_Learning_2017/blob/master/HW4/HW4AnomalyDetectionBaysianNet.ipynb)
